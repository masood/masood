### Hello (Carbon-based Lifeforms)[https://vosotros.glitch.me/]!
I code, write, and research. On most days, I try learning as much as I can in hopes of churning out everything I'm learning the minute I get the chance to do so!

I like to dabble with Python and Bash, advocate for security and privacy, and read speculative fiction.
